            "Description": "<em>Wizard101</em> is one of the first true MMORPGs I ever played. Released in 2008, I was one of the first players when I was just eight years old. This game enhanced my love for magic, wizards, socialization, and in-game aesthetics. It is deeply nostalgic, and to this day, I still keep up with it when I have time as the community has kept it alive!",

            "Description": "I started playing <em>Counter-Strike</em> in 2016 with the aim of being part of the cool kids in High School. Although they never played with me, I was determined to make the $15 worth it. From there, I built a collection of Counter-Strike skins and became a trading entrepreneur. This game has since become a meditative addiction that helps me de-stress and have fun.",

            "Description": "<em>Rocket League</em> is like soccer but with flying cars! Starting my undergrad, I needed a game that was short, fun, and challenging. A buddy of mine introduced me to this game in the dorm, and I racked up thousands of hours trying to improve. It only took 4 years to achieve my goal of playing ranked with my friend. Now, the soundtracks remind me of great memories.",

The retro 3D style, music, and atmosphere create a phenomenal setting for embarking on adventures late into the night. A solid game with a great difficulty curve for solo and multiplayer alike!",

Going in blind, I had no idea what to expect except that I was a little bug in an unknown world. The story, narrative, and exploration in this game are fantastic. Itâ€™s a must-play despite my limited hours in it.",
